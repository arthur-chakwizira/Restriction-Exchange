Trajectory files
d_X_k_Y...
X is the compartment diameter in micrometers
Y is the exchange rate in /s
Each trajectory file contains the structure "positions" with fields:
  R (trajectory: N_particles x N_spatial_dimensions x N_time_points)
  opt (settings used for the simulation)
  

Example trajectories can be found at:
